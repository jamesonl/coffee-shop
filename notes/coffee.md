 - [How is coffee kept fresh?](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/08/coffee-importing-behind-scenes-coffee-warehouses-where-green-coffee-beans-are-stored.html)
    - "In the United States, major coffee ports include Houston, New Orleans, Seattle, Oakland, and New Jersey."
    - "No matter how green coffee is packed, conditions for storing it need to be climate-controlled against humidity or extreme temperatures that would damage the beans—and hopefully it was transported to the warehouse under similarly careful conditions."
    - "If it takes more work to load the coffee, they charge more—we pay $1 to have 1 bag of Grainpro-lined jute loaded from the warehouse on to a truck. A straight jute bag only costs $.60 to load since they can use hooks and hooks make the job easier."
    - "And just as it costs money each time coffee is moved, coffee is also supposed to be evaluated each time it changes location."
    - "Coffee doesn't want to hang around in a warehouse for too long, because not only does that mean people aren't roasting, selling, and buying it, it means the coffee is losing quality over time."
    - "The problem the coffee industry faces is that many countries have one harvest," explained Hallien. "**We buy and store the purchase and then pull from stock as we need it for production. Good practice is to create a purchasing and logistics scenario that allows you to rotate through coffee in a time frame that doesn't compromise quality.** If you have a coffee that you do need to store for long term then ensure that the warehouse can provide climate control to help preserve the quality of the greens in storage."
